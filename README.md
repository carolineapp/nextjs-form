This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Consultation Project

This project uses Next, React, Formik and Tailwind
I chose the above technologies because they are fairly simple to set up but they are easy to scale up for larger applications

## Getting Started

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Caveats

I am aware that it takes quite a long time for the page to navigate to `/consultation`. Apparently this is a known issue and I would look into a solution if I were to spend more time on this project
